# Game Characters API 

Welcome to our Backend API repository. 

## Introduction

Game Characters API is [ RESTful ](https://restfulapi.net/) based on the game series [Final Fantasy](https://www.finalfantasy.com/).

This documentation will provide you with all the relevent information needed for you to make your HTTP requests such as the available endpoints together with their associated inputs (examples shown).

Please also feel free to visit our [ Internet Site ](https://gamecharactersapi.netlify.app/) for an exciting adventure which includes a detailed compilation of the [Documentation](https://gamecharactersapi.netlify.app/documents). Please go [here](https://github.com/Dea314/final-project) to access our frontend repository.

## Current Version

The current version of the API is 1.
The Game Characters API is an open API, which means no authentication is required to query the data. Since no authentication is required, there is only support for GET requests. 

## Rate Limit

There is a rate limit of 60 requests per hour from each IP address to prevent harmful activity. If you reach that limit, you will receive a message and regain access after an hour.
